Provided are two Apple Shortcuts, where "Prime AI" is a helper shortcut, meant to help intialize a model before use. The "Ask AI" Shortcut supports configuration of system prompts, and context for the current chat session, allowing for quick conversations and follow-up questions. Native Shortcut functions are used to store context and create Ollama API JSON queries. As stated in the comments within the Shortcuts, some configuration is needed for a connection to your SSH server. Have fun with Ask AI!
